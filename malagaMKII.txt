1. 2 player co-op

// Weapon types / upgrades
// ----------

// I'm reconsidering the useage of ammo and weapon. To me, it seems
// that the ammo is not actually upgrading perse.
//
// When I think of a weapon being upgraded, I think of the amount of
// damage it can do and various other properties the weapon might
// have, ie. it's behaviour.
//
// Maybe an ammo upgrade would entail how many you can shoot at a
// time? Still, that does seem like a feature that would be upgraded
// to the weapon.
//
// For now I'm changing from ammo upgrade to weapon and combining the
// previous Weapon type/upgrdes with it.

Game conditions
----------
1. Complete Level
    a. kill 20 count enemies?




Game flow from a programming standpoint
1)	Player controls
----Player uses left and right to move clockwise or counter clockwise around the 
	border of the screen.
----Player uses space bar to fire projectiles from ship to center of screen

2)	Game Difficulty
----First tier of difficulty, enemies come from just the top of the screen and 
	move straight down...enemy type number 1.
----Second tier of difficulty, 
		same enemies just get faster
			or
		same enemies just get tougher
----Third tier of difficulty, enemies come from different edges of the screen and 
	are given a target (the player's position) to aim for.  Enemy travels in straight
	line toward that position until leaving the screen...enemy type number 2.
----Fourth tier of difficulty, 
		same enemies just get faster
			or
		same enemies just get tougher
----Fifth tier of difficulty, enemies come from different edges of the screen and 
	follow the player around until player is hit or player destroys enemy.
2f)	Sixth tier of difficulty, 
		same enemies just get faster
			or
		same enemies just get tougher
2g)	Seventh tier of difficulty, all enemy types spawn.
2h)	Eighth tier of difficulty, all enemy types spawn more frequently
2i)	Ninth tier of difficulty, all enemy types take damage, but player ammo reflects off
	enemies, causing a chance for player to get hit by own ammo.
2j) Tenth and final tier of difficulty, all enemy types spawn, random intervals, 
	random speeds and random hit-points with reflective shields...basically all previous
	difficulties combined.

3)	Player Perks: Each enemy no matter the type will be color coded to provide different perks for
	player.
3a)	red bricks   -> shield
3b)	blue bricks  -> ammo
3c)	green bricks -> acceleration
3d)	pink bricks  -> ship speed
3e)	brown bricks -> bomb (destroy all enemies on screen) 

4)	Enemy spawn mechanics
