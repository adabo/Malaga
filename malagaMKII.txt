// Weapon types / upgrades
// ----------

// I'm reconsidering the useage of ammo and weapon. To me, it seems
// that the ammo is not actually upgrading perse.
//
// When I think of a weapon being upgraded, I think of the amount of
// damage it can do and various other properties the weapon might
// have, ie. it's behaviour.
//
// Maybe an ammo upgrade would entail how many you can shoot at a
// time? Still, that does seem like a feature that would be upgraded
// to the weapon.
//
// For now I'm changing from ammo upgrade to weapon and combining the
// previous Weapon type/upgrdes with it.

// Ammo upgrades
