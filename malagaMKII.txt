1)	Game flow from a programming standpoint
2)	Player uses left and right to move clockwise or counter clockwise around the 
	border of the screen.
3a)	First tier of difficulty, enemies come from just the top of the screen and 
	move straight down...enemy type number 1.
3b)	Second tier of difficulty, 
		same enemies just get faster
			or
		same enemies just get tougher
3c)	Third tier of difficulty, enemies come from different edges of the screen and 
	are given a target (the player's position) to aim for.  Enemy travels in straight
	line toward that position until leaving the screen...enemy type number 2.
3d)	Fourth tier of difficulty, 
		same enemies just get faster
			or
		same enemies just get tougher
3e)	Fifth tier of difficulty, enemies come from different edges of the screen and 
	follow the player around until player is hit or player destroys enemy.
3f)	Sixth tier of difficulty, 
		same enemies just get faster
			or
		same enemies just get tougher
3g)	Seventh tier of difficulty, all enemy types spawn.
3h)	Eighth tier of difficulty, all enemy types spawn more frequently
3i)	Ninth tier of difficulty, all enemy types take damage, but player ammo reflects off
	enemies, causing a chance for player to get hit by own ammo.
3j) Tenth and final tier of difficulty, all enemy types spawn, random intervals, 
	random speeds and random hit-points with reflective shields...basically all previous
	difficulties combined.
4)	Each enemy no matter the type will be color coded to provide different perks for
	player.
4a)	red bricks   -> shield
4b)	blue bricks  -> ammo
4c)	green bricks -> acceleration
4d)	pink bricks  -> ship speed
4e)	brown bricks -> bomb (destroy all enemies on screen)
